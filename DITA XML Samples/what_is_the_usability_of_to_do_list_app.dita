        <ul id="ul_rbv_4yk_zcc">
            <li><b>Task Organization:</b> User can easily create, edit, and delete tasks with just a
                few taps. They can assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks so
                users can focus on what's most important.</li>
            <li><b>Time Management:</b> Users can add due dates and times to tasks to stay on track
                and avoid missing deadlines. Also, they can set reminders for tasks to receive
                alerts when deadlines are approaching or tasks need attention.</li>
            <li><b>Productivity Enhancement: </b>Users can organize tasks based on urgency and
                importance, improving productivity and focus. The visual cues like color coding,
                percentage completion, or progress bars can help them quickly assess task
                statuses.</li>
            <li><b>Cross-Device Complatibility:</b> The users can sync tasks across multiple devices
                (e.g., phone, tablet, laptop) so they can access their to-do lists anywhere.</li>
            <li><b>Accessibility: </b>The ability to create and manage tasks even without an
                internet connection ensures that users can stay productive anytime.</li>
        </ul>
